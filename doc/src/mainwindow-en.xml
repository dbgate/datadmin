<p>
	
The main window is divided into three parts
<ul>
     <li> Left - Connection Tree - on this tab you can see all defined database connections, data archives, diagrams,
     in short, all the data objects. On the Addons tab is list of addons (currently using of addons tree is quite complicated).</li>
     <li> Right - space for open documents. By default, tabs 
     Summary (displays a summary of the currently selected node in the tree) and Data Browser (allows to display and edit table data) are open</li>
     <li> Bottom - on the tab Data there is cell data editor allowing edit cell data in various formats. This editor shows always the contents of the last
     cell selected from data browser (or from the table open in a separate panel). On the Log tab tehre are log reports (must be explicitly turned on in settings),
     On the Processes tab, there is a list of running and finished processes (eg. export to data archive, export table data)</li>
</ul>
